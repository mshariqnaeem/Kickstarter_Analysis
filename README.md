## Overview of Project
Analyze how different campaigns fared in comparison to the launch date of the campaigns along with the funding goals.

### Purpose
To understand how to use excel to analyze and filter data and to come to conclusions by using tools to make information presentable

## Analysis and Challenges
**Two different analysis were required for this challenge**
**1.** Theather outcomes by launch date

**2.** Outcome Results based on Goal amount 
Both analysis had different information we could extract to understand why certain outcomes are not as successful as others which will be explained below 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
**Theater Outcome by Launch Date**
by analyzing the pivot table which was created along with the !Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png chart we can see that Theatre campaigns which were started in the months of May and June were the most successful. From this we can make an assumption that the best time to launch a Theater campaign would be in the summer months for the highest chance of success

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
**Outcomes Based on Goals**
from looking at our data and !Outcomes_vs_Goals.png chart the greater the goal amount, the less likely a campaign is to succeed
This is indicated by the rising number of failed or cancelled campaigns as the goal value rises

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some challenges that I initially ran into was making the data presentable once it had been charted.
An example of this is how the axis were very spread out, however by using the chart format tab I was able to make the data look more clean.
Another issue I ran in was how to make the data on the pivot table the most readable. This however was easily solved by learning how to use the filters, rows and columns sections of the pivot tables 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
**1.** the most succcessful campaigns are started during the summer months

**2.** the break even point between successful and failed campaigns seems to be at the month of December which would indicate that this is possibly one of the worst times to start a campaign

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
**1.** We can conclude that the lower the inital goal amount the more likely a campaign is to succeed

**2.** In comparison we can also conclude that the higher the goal amount, the higher the percentage of failure of the outcome.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
A limitation of this data set is that we are only analyzing the outcome of a specific category vs all categories.
if we were to analyze all categories by launch date we could possibly come to a better conclusion when is the best time to launch a campaign as we have the results of not just 1 but further categories as well.
We are also only analyzing the graph from a simple numerical point of view vs using statistical data.
If we were to analyze the mean, standard deviation and the IQR, we could possibly come to a better conclusion of which outcomes whether they be based on launch date or by goal amounts are the most and least successful

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could use stacked columns or box and whisker plots if we were to further analyze the data
